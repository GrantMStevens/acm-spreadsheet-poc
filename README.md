# Spreadsheet library POC for ACM

To run the app:

```
npm install
npm run dev 
```

You can access the app at https://localhost:3000

To change the port that this app runs on, create a `.env` file in the root of the repo and add a property called `VITE_APP_PORT`

eg:

```
VITE_APP_PORT = 3001
```
